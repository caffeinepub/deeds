  "summary": "Diff adds a new bottom tab navigation component and wires it into ReelHome (including empty-feed state), plus adds corresponding CSS. However, the wheel navigation components/hooks appear to still exist (they are modified, not removed), so full removal of wheel-based navigation and its hooks/styling is not clearly completed from the provided diff summary.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Remove the wheel-based navigation mechanic from the app, including its UI, hooks, and styling, so no wheel navigation is rendered or referenced anywhere in the reel experience.",
      "reason": "The wheel navigation files still exist and are shown as modified rather than removed; the diff summary does not demonstrate that WheelNavScroller and the wheel-scroller hook are no longer referenced anywhere, nor that wheel-specific CSS/classes are fully removed/unreferenced.",
